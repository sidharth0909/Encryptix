# Encryptix
Hello everyone my name is sidharth saholiya, i am currently pursuing Bachelor of engineering in IT (Currently in sem 7)
I am currency a Machine Learning intern at encryptix.so encryptix provide 4 month virtual internship, where you are given a set of project list with their corresponding dataset and the intern has to complete any 3 projects from it. This is a great opportunity to learn and understand new models and Algorithms.

This Repo will contain 3 Task
#1. Movie Genre Classification - This Projects lets you understand the basics of the Machine learning Project. It also explores important concepts such as Lancaster Stemmer, Text Vectorization Using TF-IDF, and the Naive bayes model
Structure of the Project:
1. Import the necessary Libraries
2. Load the Dataset
3. Perform some basic commands to understand the data. Eg. df.head(), df.info() and so on
4.Visualization and EDA
5. Data Preprocessing and Text Cleaning
6. Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
7. Splitting Data and Building Model
8. Prediction and Result

Necessary Definitions
1. TF-IDF: stands for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency of records. It can be defined as the calculation of how relevant a word in a series or corpus is to a text. 
2. Lancaster Stemmer: This initialises the Lancaster Stemmer, a tool used in natural language processing (NLP) to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run"). This process is known as stemming.
3. stopwords.words('english'): This retrieves a list of common English stopwords from the NLTK library (like "the", "and", "is"), which are often removed from text during preprocessing because they don't carry significant meaning.

#2. Spam Sms Detection - 


#3. Credit card Fraud Detection -
